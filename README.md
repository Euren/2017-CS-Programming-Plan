# 2017 CS/Programming Study Plan

This is my modified version of John Washam's Google Interview University, adding in additional resources and removing the Google interview focus to make it solely about CS and programming in general.

This will all be done in line with my regular web development work and practice, which always takes precedent since it's what the job is in!

## Web Development Goals

	- (at work) Have a functional ticketing system written in .NET
	- (at work) Have a functional network monitor written in MEAN+Python
	- Design and build 4 fake websites for real companies as mockups
	- Write a cool interactive web app/game
	- Additional/option API's to mess with:
		- Twitter (https://dev.twitter.com/docs)
		- Pinterest (https://developers.pinterest.com/)
		- Google Geocoding (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)
		- Pokemon (http://pokeapi.co/)
		- Nutritionix (https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)
		- The Counted (https://thecountedapi.com/)
		- Battle.net (https://dev.battle.net/)
		- Watson (https://watson-api-explorer.mybluemix.net/)
		- Wolfram Alpha (http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/)
		- BreweryDB (http://www.brewerydb.com/browse)
		- Common Crawl (http://commoncrawl.org/)
		- FitBit (https://dev.fitbit.com/eu)
		- Steam (https://steamcommunity.com/dev)

## 3a Using the references for each subject on the Daily Plan, I will move onto studying the following books:
	- Cracking the Coding Interview
	- Programming Interviews Exposed
	- Algorithm Design Manual
	- Algorithms by Sedgewick [WAITING ON  SECOND MOOC, FINISHED WITH FIRST]
